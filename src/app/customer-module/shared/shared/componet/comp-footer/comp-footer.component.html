                <h3>Information We Collect </h3>

                <p>Talenthooks.com collects Personal Information in a fair and lawful way, for the purposes
                    specified in this Privacy Policy. The types of information we generally may obtain can include:
                </p>



                <p>Personal Information provided by you (such as via a resume uploaded to our Site or a job
                    application sent using our Site) or collected from third party sources as described below. </p>

                <p>Publically available data about you from third party sites and sources, including profiles
                    created by you on other websites, or other information you have publicly shared for the purpose
                    of advertising or informing others about your background. </p>

                <p>Username and password for the account you may establish on our Sites. </p>

                <p>Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name
                    and billing address) if you buy products on our Sites. </p>

                <p>Your demographic information (such as zip or postal code, occupation, education and experience,
                    and if you choose to provide it, age, gender and race or ethnicity). We collect this information
                    either through the registration process, from your resume or in the manner described below. </p>

                <p>Job search behavior and preferences, and a record of the searches that you make on our Sites.
                </p>

                <p>Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us
                    by third parties. </p>

                <p>Technical information about your use of our sites or apps, as described below.</p>

                <p>We have obtained and may continue to obtain information about you from various sources, including
                    directly from you via our Sites, when you call or email us or communicate with us through social
                    media, or when you participate in events, contests or other promotions. We also may obtain
                    information about you from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and
                    other third parties, as well as from publicly available information. </p>



                <p>Many people invest significant time and energy to promote their professional reputation through
                    public forums on the Internet. We gather information relevant to your career history and work
                    experience from these widely dispersed publicly available sources, including social media sites
                    you may be part of, forming a "Profile." We make this Profile available to independent and
                    company-specific recruiters for recruitment leads in a database known as "Employee Access." Use
                    of these Profiles are limited to recruitment lead generation and may not be used for
                    determinations about employment or other eligibility. If you would prefer that we not compile
                    and make this information available to recruiters, you can delete your account from the site.
                </p>



                <p>If you create a profile on TalentHooks.com, we may collect your social media profile information,
                    including your social network site user ID, work email address, name, city, state, social
                    network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.
                    You may be asked to enter this information directly, or we can automatically collect it by
                    syncing to your social media profiles. We request this information so that we may automate
                    completion of registration forms or job applications with information stored in your social
                    media profile. In addition, when you visit our Site, we may collect certain information by
                    automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we may collect automatically
                    via the Sites can include: </p>



                <p>Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and
                    the device, browser and operating system type and other operating system support information).

                    in the "Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers" section below. </p>

                </p>

                <h3>Information We Share </h3>
                <p>We provide a platform that allows other members and third parties to see user profiles, and give
                    access to those profiles or create other profiles based on platform profiles and other
                    information from third parties or publicly available sources that we may in turn sell to third
                    parties as part of our products and services. This section of our policy describes the various
                    ways in which we may share your personal information. </p>



                <p>We share the information that we collect from you or from third party sources with our affiliated
                    companies, recruiters, educators and service providers. In the normal course of performing
                    services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within Talenthooks.com and its
                    affiliates for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy; as well as research and
                    statistical purposes, system administration and crime prevention or detection. </p>



                <p>Recruiters may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a
                    job with a company through the Sites, the information supplied by you or shared through site
                    products and services may become part of such company's database. Similarly, if your
                    Talenthooks.com resume or your Profile is downloaded by a recruiter, your information may become
                    a part of their database. In these instances, the use of such information by the recruiter will
                    be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company's
                    use of your information. </p>



                <p>Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is "hosted" or "co-branded" by
                    another company then that information will be made available to both talenthooks.com and the
                    hosting/co-branding company. Talenhooks.com is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding
                    company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does
                    with your information. You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company
                    to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
                </p>



                <p>All users should be aware that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information
                    (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or
                    any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may
                    result in unsolicited messages from third parties. We also may share Personal Information with
                    our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These
                    service providers are required by contract or law to only use or disclose the information as
                    necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law. Where we have
                    knowledge that a service provider or partner is using or disclosing Personal Information in a
                    manner inconsistent with this Policy, Talenthooks.com will take reasonable steps to prevent or
                    stop such improper use and/or disclosure. </p>



                <p>We preserve the right to disclose without your prior permission any Personal Information about
                    you or your use of this Site if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
                    (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Talenthooks.com, employees, other users
                    of the Site, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of the Site;
                    (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority; or (d)
                    respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose
                    Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
                    process or governmental request. </p>



                <p>In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the
                    event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of
                    the site. </p>


                <h3>Analytics </h3>
                <p>We may combine certain non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data, or otherwise anonymized or
                    de-identified data about our users, and use such data to prepare reports for our users
                    (typically recruiters or educators). "Aggregate Data" for our purposes is demographic
                    information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such
                    as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.
                    Aggregate Data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not
                    identify any specific individuals. We may also use and share anonymized or de-identified data to
                    track trends in the labor market as well as use of our products and services. Some Aggregate
                    Data analytics reports can be used to better understand individual Profiles. For example, we may
                    provide aggregate data trends on the longevity of specific career positions to allow recruiters
                    to identify Profiles of individuals who may be more likely to be interested in making a career
                    move. </p>



                <p>We also use third party analytics services to help better understand the use of our sites, which
                    is further described in the Cookies section below. </p>

                <p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of recruiters with open positions
                    each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the
                    email address and password that you supply. When you return to the Sites in the future you will
                    use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume. </p>



                <p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to publicly posting
                    their resume on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, Talenthooks.com has 2
                    levels of resume privacy from which you can choose. Please note that these privacy settings only
                    apply to whether or not your resume is publicly available to third parties. Site will still
                    collect, use or disclose Personal Information, as well as anonymous, aggregated information
                    about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. </p>

                <h5>Standard Posting on the Searchable Database </h5>

                <p>When you post your resume to the Sites, it will automatically be visible to employers unless you
                    opt-out of this default option and make your resume private (described below). The standard
                    posting option gives you the most visibility to the broadest recruiter audience possible by
                    making your resume searchable in our resume database. If you select this option, any registered
                    company (or individual recruiter) user who purchases/Attains access to the database can view
                    your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume). </p>

                <h5>Private Posting </h5>

                <p>Private posting prevents your resume from being searchable by recruiters in the our resume
                    database. The benefit of uploading a private resume is that you can quickly and easily apply for
                    specific jobs with the resume that you have on file without retyping your information. </p>

                <p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable databases to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee
                    that other parties will not gain access to these searchable databases. While we limit access and
                    use of information from our products and services in our Terms and Conditions, we cannot control
                    the use of information by third parties once they obtain that information from our products and
                    services or other publicly available sources. Accordingly, you should not put information you
                    would not want made public in your resume or to a public websiteâregardless of whether you elect
                    a standard posting or a private posting. </p>

                    files or databases. Additionally, if you have applied to a job at a particular company in the
                    past, that company will still have access to your resume. We cannot control the retention, use
                    or privacy of resumes or Profiles that have been downloaded by third parties, and, you will not
                    be able to delete data held by third parties that already have accessed and downloaded your

                    described in this privacy policy. </p>
                <p>Please allow up to thirty days to process your account or Profile deletion request. </p>


                <h3>About Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers </h3>
                <p>A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected
                    device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the
                    browser. A "web beacon," is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in
                    combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger
                    than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a website or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the
                    behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail. </p>



                <p>Talenthooks.com uses cookies and other similar technologies for the convenience of our users.
                    Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.

                    jobs viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on your

                <p>Talenthooks.com permits third party cookies on its Sites. For example, third party tools located
                    on the Sites, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember
                    user preference settings. Site also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which

                    (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Site. These third party web
                    analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us
                    understand how visitors engage with the Sites. </p>



                <p>We use third-party advertising companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard
                    drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to
                    serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the
                    ads appeared. These companies may use information about your visits to these Sites and to other
                    sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our
                    Sites or on other, third party, sites. We also may give third party advertisers the ability to
                    tailor their advertisements on our Sites using demographic and preference information we provide
                    to them in aggregate form. This information does not identify you individually. </p>



                <p>These companies operate under their own privacy policies and Talenthooks.com encourages you to be
                    aware of the privacy policies of such companies. Site does not have control over or access to

                    advertisers. </p>



                <p>Our Site does not respond to web browser "do not track" signals. However, we endeavor to comply
                    with industry self-regulatory advertising principles. To help prevent and limit the automatic
                    collection of information by any participating third party advertisers, including the collection
                    of personally identifiable information about an individual's online activities over time and
                    across third-party Web sites or online services, you may opt-out of such collection by clicking
                    the Ad Choices icon located within the ad, by accessing the "about ads" opt-out site, or by
                    accessing the NAI opt-out site. Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you buy a new
                    computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task
                    again. To obtain instructions regarding deleting or disabling cookies from third party
                    advertising companies that are not members of the About Ads or NAI self-regulatory behavioral ad
                    opt-out groups, please click here. </p>



                <p>In addition, some of the recruiters that use our Sites may place cookies on your computer through
                    their job postings and may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely. Often,
                    recruiters use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring
                    how many users who view their postings later became job applicants. </p>

                <h3>Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Recruiters</h3>
                <p>You should use your own careful judgment about whether and what information to provide to
                    recruiters. </p>

                <p>DO NOT PUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION, such as your Social Security number, on your resume. </p>

                <p>If restricted or prohibited by the local laws in the jurisdiction where you reside, do not
                    provide Talenthooks.com, or otherwise include in your resumes or Profiles other sensitive
                    information that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
                    beliefs, trade-union membership, health or sex life, genetic or biometric data, the commission
                    of criminal offences or proceedings or unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated
                    penalties or fines. </p>

                <p>Talenthooks.com is open to the public, and we cannot guarantee that all users of our services
                    have a legitimate need to the information they seek. </p>

                <p>Do not provide your social security number, national identification number or any state,
                    provincial or other local identification number to any third party via online application.
                    Identity thieves may attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information. Do not provide
                    any non-work related personal information (i.e., your social security number or any other state
                    or national identification number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.
                </p>

                <p>Job seekers should never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction
                    of any sort. </p>

                <p>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country. </p>
