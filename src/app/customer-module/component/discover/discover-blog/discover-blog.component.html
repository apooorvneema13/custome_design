            When it comes to foundation makeup, nothing offers ease and
            versatility quite as well as a stick foundation like Teint Idôle
            Ultra 5-in-1 Foundation Stick. Its small size and cream to powder
            foundation formula make it easy to apply on the go — and it just got
            a makeover (complete with a built-in foundation brush) to make
            application even more seamless. Not only that, but there are
            multiple ways to use the foundation stick beyond your usual
            foundation makeup. Whether you’re looking to use it as your everyday
            foundation or a natural-looking bronzer, this foundation stick can
            help.

            fast and flawless application on skin; depending on where you brush
            on foundation, you can get a different effect. Simply blend it in a
            circular, outward motion for even, natural-looking finish.

            For multiple uses, you may need two or three shades of the
            foundation stick. First, find the right foundation shade for your
            skin tone. (Here’s a guide to doing just that.) Once you’ve
            determined your foundation match, you can use that as a baseline for
            finding your best shade for concealer makeup or contour. You can
            also use the stick foundation as a stick concealer, highlighter,
            contour stick or bronzer over a liquid foundation, such as Teint
            Idôle Ultra 24H Long Wear Foundation. Keep reading to learn exactly
            how to apply this multitasking foundation stick.
