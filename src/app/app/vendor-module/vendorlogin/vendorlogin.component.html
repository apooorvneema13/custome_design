                            managers, members, trustees, shareholders, employees and agents (“Indemnified Parties”) for
                            and against all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable advocate’s
                            fees) incurred or to be incurred by the Indemnified Parties that arise out of, in any way
                            relate to, or result from any breach by the Vendor of any of the provisions of this
                            Agreement, or breach of any laws by the Vendor, or negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of
                            the Vendor or its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders,

                            entitled to receive the sale consideration from the payment gateway which otherwise would
                            have remitted by such payment gateway to the Vendor and/or set off the amounts received by
                            Bumi from the end customer who has availed cash on delivery services.
                            11.2 Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in this agreement, in any event Bumi and
                            its affiliates shall not be liable (whether in contract, warranty, tort (including, but not
                            limited to, negligence), product liability or other theory), to the Vendor or any other

                            anticipated profits, loss of goodwill, loss of Business or data) arising out of or in
                            relation this agreement. Bumi’s entire liability to Vendor under this Agreement or under any

                            sustained by the Vendor as a result of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Bumi
                            and its affiliate and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents in the
